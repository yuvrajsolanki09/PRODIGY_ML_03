# Cat and Dog Recognition Machine Learning Project


This machine learning project is designed to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs.To classify images, here we are using SVM. Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language and Support vector machine(SVM) is subsumed under Scikit-learn
